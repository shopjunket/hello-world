# hello-world

<br> <br> Hi! I'm a <i> super basic HTML person of the GenX variety </i> running an ecommerce website and wanting to automate for scale. <br> <br>Getting started w/ Integromat has sent me down a bunch of ADHD-induced rabbit holes, including this one... I'm hoping to learn a bunch and figure out how to API/automate the hell out of my workflows.
